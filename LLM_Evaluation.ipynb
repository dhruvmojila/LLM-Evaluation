The query is \\\"Write haiku for Virat Kohli.\\\" This indicates that the assistant is being asked to create a haiku poem about Virat Kohli, which is a subjective and creative task.\\n\\nStep 2: Examine the reference text to see if it provides any information that could be used to create a haiku about Virat Kohli. The reference text is a validation annotation that states the answer provides a haiku about Virat Kohli as requested in the question. However, it does not provide any specific information about Virat Kohli's characteristics, skills, or personality traits that could be used to create a haiku.\\n\\nStep 3: Analyze the answer to see if it is based on the reference text or if it assumes information that is not available in the reference text. The answer is a haiku poem that describes Virat Kohli as \\\"Battling on the field, / Graceful, fierce, a cricketing king, / Virat's spirit soars.\\\" This haiku assumes that Virat Kohli is a skilled and fierce cricketer, and that he has a strong and soaring spirit.\\n\\nStep 4: Determine if the answer is factual or hallucinated based on the reference text. Since the reference text does not provide any specific information about Virat Kohli's characteristics, skills, or personality traits, the answer is making assumptions about him that are not based on the reference text.

The reference text also provides the haiku itself, which is \\\"Battling on the field, Graceful, fierce, a cricketing king, Virat's spirit soars.\\\" However, the answer provided does not match the haiku in the reference text. It only states that the answer provides a haiku about Virat Kohli, without actually providing the haiku. This discrepancy suggests that the answer may be hallucinated, as it does not provide the actual haiku as requested in the query. Furthermore, the reference text does not mention any other haiku about Virat Kohli, which implies that the answer is not based on the reference text.

The reference text states that the answer is in the correct format and provides a haiku about Virat Kohli as requested.\\n\\nStep 5: Based on the analysis, the answer seems to match the request in the question and is supported by the reference text.
